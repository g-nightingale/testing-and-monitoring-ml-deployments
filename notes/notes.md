## ML System Lifecycle
- Machine learning pipelines require machine learning centric tests at various levels
    - Traditional tests
    - ML-Specific tests
        - Data and model tests
    - Monitoring and skew tests
    - Data prediction and system monitoring

## Testing Concepts for ML Systems
### Testing Scope
- Development environment
    - Unit, integration and acceptance tests
    - Differential tests
    - Benchmark tests
    - Load tests
- Production environment
    - Shadow mode testing
    - Canary releases
    - Observability & monitoring
    - Logging & tracing
    - Alerting

### Why test?
- Confidence
    - Have confidence in your system
- Prediction
    - Your system's future reliability
    - Analyse the uncertainty incurred by any system change
- What change are we tracking?
    - Confidence that functionality remains unchanged

**Testing is the way we show our system functionality is what we expect it to be, even as we make changes to the system**

The real value of testing occurs with system change

### Testing ML Systems
- ML system = data + model + code
- Behaviour of ML systems is often learnt from data, as opposed to specified from code
- ML systems require extensive testing because the rules governing the system behaviour are less clearly defined

### Testing theory
- Traditional tests
    - Unit tests 
        - Run on classes and functions
    - Integration tests
        - Run on an assembled components
    - System tests
        - End-to-end functionality of our system
- Tests are like armour
    - No armour, very vulnerable
    - Too much armour, cannot move

### Exercises
- Schema
    - Best practice for data validation
    - Collection of rules that specify the expected values for a set of fields

## Unit testing ML systems
### Python code conventions
- PEP8 -> style guide
- Type hints -> PEP 484
- Literal string interpolation -> PEP 498
    - f strings
- Forcing keyword arguments
    - keyword must be passed along with value
    - def my_function(*, foo):
        pass 
    - my_function(foo="bar")

### Intro to Pytest
- Defacto standard in industry
- Modular fixtures is the killer feature
    - Reusable test setups
- conftest.py file
    - Stores fixtures
    - Made available to test modules
- Parameterisation
    - For testing multiple values
    - Good for testing empty strings, None etc as well as valid values

### Using Tox
- Creates isolated environments for running tests
- Test against different versions of Python and OS
- Solves problems with missing Python paths
