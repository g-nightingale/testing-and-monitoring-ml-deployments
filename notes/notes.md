## ML System Lifecycle
- Machine learning pipelines require machine learning centric tests at various levels
    - Traditional tests
    - ML-Specific tests
        - Data and model tests
    - Monitoring and skew tests
    - Data prediction and system monitoring

## Testing Concepts for ML Systems
### Testing Scope
- Development environment
    - Unit, integration and acceptance tests
    - Differential tests
    - Benchmark tests
    - Load tests
- Production environment
    - Shadow mode testing
    - Canary releases
    - Observability & monitoring
    - Logging & tracing
    - Alerting

### Why test?
- Confidence
    - Have confidence in your system
- Prediction
    - Your system's future reliability
    - Analyse the uncertainty incurred by any system change
- What change are we tracking?
    - Confidence that functionality remains unchanged
